Universal Ball Bearing Joint
============================

I was tired of using crappy prints of universal joints. So I
designed this guy, which should work for tiny universal joints
up to the big guys, assuming you have an oiled ball beraing to
work with.

Any ball bearing will do, just fire 'er up in OpenSCAD and
modify the dimensions for the bearing ou have. I swear, it
was made to be easy!
